  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html). '

  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html)
    to name Git branches the way you named this one: "`rultor`". You''ve earned -10
    points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as the number of the
    ticket that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name, for example, would
    be "`11`". Your running balance is [-20](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/ghiqc/zerocracy/ghiqc-vitals.html). '

  details: It's time to punish @h1alexbel for the branch named as 'crates-credentials-format',
    which is wrong in h1alexbel/ghiqc#19, the penalty amount is -10.
  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B We noticed your branch name \"`crates-credentials-format`\"
    isn't quite following our [naming conventions](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).
    Remember, it's best to use the ticket number as the branch name - something like
    \"`18`\" would've been perfect here. As per our policy, that's a -10 point deduction,
    bringing your balance to [-20](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/ghiqc/zerocracy/ghiqc-vitals.html).
    Let's stick to the ticket numbers next time to keep things smooth and avoid penalties.
    Keep up the good work otherwise!"

    snagged +5 points this time. We started with a cool +25, but had to trim a bit
    for the light comments and hits-of-code. No worries though, you're still crushing
    it with a total of [+33 points](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/ghiqc/zerocracy/ghiqc-vitals.html)!
    Keep up the great work and let's see those numbers soar! \U0001F4AA"
